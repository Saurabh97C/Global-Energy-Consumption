# Global-Energy-Consumption Analysis

World energy supply and cosumption is based on global production, preparation of fuel, power generation and energy transport. Many countries need energy supply and consumption for its developpment, for its economic and also for its industrialization.

Energy consumption for some countries in the world is very high than others countries. The world needs to shift away from fossil fuels to an energy mix dominated by low-carbon sources of energy â€“ renewable technologies and nuclear power.

## About the dataset
The datasets used in this project is publicly accessible in Our World in Data. Datasets contains the following characteristics and indicators:

* Data from 1900 to 2019
* 116 countries 
* 8 types of energy sources (values in Exajoule)
 * Fossil fuels : Oil, Gas, Coal
 * Low carbon fuels: Solar, Hydro, Nuclear, Wind, Geo Biomass

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- Google Colab

## Aim of the analysis
1. Global energy consumption for the years 1965 to 2019.

2. Decrease in fossil energy consumption for the past 10 years (2009 to 2019).

3. Finding the most promising renewable energy source for the past 20 years (1999 to 2019).

4. Which countries get the highest share of energy from low-carbon sources?

5. Analyzing low-carbon energy consumption for the year 2019, top consuming countries

6. Prediction of low-carbon energy resource consumption for the next 10 years.

The above EDA will give us an idea about which countries are putting efforts to shift towards a low-carbon, renewable energy source.
